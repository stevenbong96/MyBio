The overall of this HW is to utilize the use of Bootstrap and deepen the understand of CSS styling and positioning such as rows and columns on website. The students need to have basic understanding on how to use these features as these are the minimum requirements in doing this HW. For this HW, I did several things in step, which listed as below:
   1. Made 3 HTML files and 1 CSS file
   2. Made the navbar, main section, footer, and layout with the exact same position as the reference
   3. In index, I used Bootstrap to put the navbar and changed layout positioning of the navbar
   4. After done with laying out, copy and paste the code in the body section to other 2 HTML files (contact and portfolio)
   5. In portfolio, I used 1 row and 1 column principle along with multiple images sub rows and 2 sub columns
   6. In contact, I made the exact layout and content as referenced in the images folder
   7. Added CSS style to put some styling to the HTML files
   8. Added media queries to make a responsive layout and design for smaller windows
   9. Added couple of images to reflect the website with my own taste
