                        Hello! <br> My name is Steven Bong and I'm from Jakarta, Indonesia. For those of you who don't know, Indonesia is located in South East Asia and has tropical season all year long. I spent my whole time in Jakarta since I was born. In 2014, I came to USA to continue my study at Edmonds Community College in Edmonds, WA. Then, after I got my AA degree, I transferred down to Oregon State University in 2016 to purse my Bachelor's Degree. However, a year later, I decided to transfer to Texas A&M University for my final destination before I graduated. <br> <br>I chose Texas because I have never been there before and would like to explore more in MidWest / SouthWest area, but things did not go pretty smooth after I graduated since I wasn't able to get a job in Texas. That's why I decided to move back to Seattle due to couple reasons and one of them is due to the extreme weather in Texas (FYI: Temperature in Texas during summer could reach up to 110 F!!!!). Well, that's a little bit of myself and my past journey as a student in USA! In the portfolio section, you will find couple of photos about me
